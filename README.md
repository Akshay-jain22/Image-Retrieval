# Image-Retrieval
Ensembling of IR and Deep Learning Models for Image Retrieval like VGG, BERT &amp; TF-IDF

## Setup
- Download [Flickr8k Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k)
- Change Image_Dataset_Path and Text_Dataset_Path accordingly
- Img_Pkl and TF_IDF_Corpus_Path will be automatically created when you run the code for the first time. From next time onwards, it'll use the same files.
- Install required modules using pip

  `
  pip install matplotlib tensorflow keras numpy pickle sklearn nltk pandas sentence-transformers
  `

- Run the code using Jupyter Notebook Module of Python or use Kaggle to run.

NOTE - The Code may require high RAM so better to run it on Kaggle.
